### Configuring focus parameter

# Testing on Mix of "Swale" in Translab. LFE routed to 2 subs. [8.8.2 speaker config]

Focus Levels:

1 = Best Level Balance, Not very Localized
1.5 = Sweet Spot - Localized but slightly dispersed,mix between sub and loudpseakers needs to be adjusted
2 = Strong localization but levels need to be adjusted
2.5 = Mix Starts to get Muddy

Takeaways:

- make 1.5 default for now
- Conduct further testing to find ideal range between 1.1 and 1.5
- subs need to be updated -- energy needs to be distributed based on number of subs
